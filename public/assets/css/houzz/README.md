#Houzz-icon-font

This is just a font icon to *temporarily* supplement [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) with a [Houzz](http://houzz.com) icon since it's been [requested](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/issues/2039) *many* times.

Hopefully it will be added to Font Awesome soon, but in the mean time this seems to be working well for me.

# Usage

Include the css inside your `head` tag
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/houzz-icon-font.css">
```

You can use this icon just like you would Font Awesome    
```html
<i class="icon-houzz"></i>
```

It's even working out of the box with Font Awesome's stack feature!   
```html
<span class="fa-stack">
  <i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
  <i class="icon-houzz fa-inverse fa-stack-1x"></i>
</span>
```



## Thanks

I wanted to give a **big thanks** to [@endtwist](https://github.com/endtwist) and [@kaizau](https://github.com/kaizau) for their awesome work on [FontCustom](https://github.com/FontCustom/fontcustom). FontCustom made this *super* fucking easy.
